/*
    Following on from successfully implementing Euclid's Algorithm,
    I have created the Bezout's Algorithm (Taught to us as: 'Reverse
    Euclid's Algorithm') in C to further learn the language.

    Later plans will be to combine both into a single C program which
    will then allow you to choose which you wish to do.

/*
    Dev notes, remove after implemented:

    m(a) + n(b) = gcd(a, b)

    a + b = gcd(a, b)/m/n

    Have to get the opening algorithm first.
