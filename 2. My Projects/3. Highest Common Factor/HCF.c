    So this while loop runs only while 'result' is greater than zero.
    While doing that, it sees if 'a' AND 'b' are evenly divisible by 'result', if so, it ends the loop.
    If not, it decrements result and repeats the loop.
    This seems like it is ultimately a very ineffecient design because it's just brute-forcing the answer in a while loop.
