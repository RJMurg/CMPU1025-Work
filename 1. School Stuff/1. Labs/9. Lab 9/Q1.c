/*
    Write a program declaring an integer (num1), a character (char1) and 2 pointers (prt1 that points to an integer and ptr2 that points to a character).
    Initialise num1 and char1 to contain an integer and hcaracter.
    Initialise ptr1 to point to num1 and initialise ptr2 to point to char1.

    Your program should then:
    a) Print the contents AND address of num1 and char1 (on separate lines).
    b) Print the contents of ptr1 and ptr2. (The output should be the same as the addresses printed in a).
    c) Using the dereference operator, print the content of the address stored in prt1 and ptr2.

    Do ptr1 and ptr2 have address locations? Check and see, i.e., print the address of ptr1 and ptr2.

    Try changing the delimiters in your printf statements and see what happens.
