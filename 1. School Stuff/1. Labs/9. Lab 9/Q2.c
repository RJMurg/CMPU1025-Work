/*
    Modify Q1 to:
    a) Declare a pointer ptr3 that points to an integer Initialise this to point to a character. Does this compile, why or why not?
    b) Using the dereference operator, print the contents of the address in ptr3 with %d AND %c. Is there a difference? If yes explain why as a comment.
